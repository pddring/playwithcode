# playwithcode
Many people take their first coding steps in (Scratch)![https://scratch.mit.edu/] which is a brilliant tool for creating, playing and sharing simple games but it doesn't take too long to run into the limitations and frustrations of a block based programming language.
play.withcode.uk aims to be creative and fun next step for students who want to continue making games in a scratch like environment but using python code instead. 

This project is in it's very early stages but ultimately it'd be great to
- write and run python code in the browser
- import a scratch .sb3 file and convert it to python code
- import and edit images as sprites and costumes that can be controlled with python code
- import and edit sounds that can be controlled with python code

The long term goal is to create a free IDE aimed at students learning python. The code will be open source for anyone to access and contribute to with a free ad-supported version will be hosted at play.withcode.uk where anyone will be able to to create, share and play games. Game creators will be able to choose a cause to support with the ad revenue generated by plays, likes and shares. The ultimate goal is to enable young people to use their creative coding skills to make the world a better place.
